            <p class="margin text-justify">Content: I finished my website and I finally presented to my class and other people about my project. At first, I was having trouble figuring out how I am going to present and what I was going to present. However, I found some takeaways that helped me a lot. Some of the takeaways I developed while working on my expo elevator pitch was evaluating and taking notes on how most people setted up their expo so that I could get some ideas on How I could present my expo. This helped me a lot giving my expo elevator pitch, because there were plenty of people interested in my website. For example, I showed them the codes I used using html and css. I also explained how aframe could impact architecture in different ways.

            <p class="margin text-justify">Sources: These are my slides and expo that helped me present to other people on what my website is about. I am so proud that I used these notes, because it gave me confidence and ideas on how I will present my website.</p>

          <div class="col">
            <p class="margin text-justify">Engineering Design Process: I am currently in the six stages of the engineering design process where I was testing and evaluating my freedom website. For example, when I was making my aframe image, I had to keep testing how my house was going to look like. I had to keep sizing the a-triangle using vertex-a, vertex-b, and vertex-c.</p>

          <div class="col">
            <p class="margin text-justify">Reflection: Some of the challenges I developed while making this website was making the a-scene, adding the images,and customizing the text. Some of the takeaways I developed while making this was learning how to use the components from Aframe by asking for help and learning how to use it. For example, I learned that you size the a-triangle with vertex-a "0 0.5 0", vertex-b "-0.5 -0.5 0", and vertex-c "0.5 0.5 0". My next steps is to add more details on my Aframe model I design Like building the interiors, and adding more background such as trees.</p>
